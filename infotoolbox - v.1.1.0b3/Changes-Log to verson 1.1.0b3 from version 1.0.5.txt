MAJOR CHANGES AND ADDITIONS
---------------------------
Additions
----------
    - Added transfer-entropy module

Changes to ENTROPY
------------------
    - Users can now plug-in their custom bias correction m-files (see ENTROPY documentation).
    - It is now possible to chose for which output options (among HRS, HiRS, HshRS, CHiR, HiR) to perform the bootstrap.
    - New faster gaussian method function.
    - Bootstrapping of the response values is now computed inside the method
      function for the gaussian method (rather than before calling the method).
      This results in faster bootstrap computation.
    - it is now possible to average over a specified number of repetitions of 
      the selected extrapolation procedure (added option PARS.XTRP).
    - The function now accepts single-stimulus cases.
    - Added method 'gsfast'

Changes to BINR
---------------
    - each response can now be binned individually with different options and parameters.
    - returns -1 where the non-responses are located.

Changes to BUILDR
-----------------
    - input must now be a matrix.
    - no longer display verbose informations.

Other
-----
Started to change the name of the toolbox from IBTB to INFOTOOLBOX.


-------------
MINOR CHANGES
-------------
- Extended and improved documentation for all functions in the toolbox.
- BUILD_LOGICAL_MASK.M substituted by FINDTRIAL.M which can also handle 0-trials cases and is slightly faster.
- Verbose mode won't check any longer whether all cells have been binned using the same number of bins.
- Verbose mode won't check any longer whether cells have been binned using integers from 0 to Nb.
- Verbose mode now performs checks on user-defined bias correction function.
- Error messages on the input matrix now make use of the matrix variable name.
- Fixed cpp comment in FASTCORR_V2 that prevented compilation with gcc.
- Fixed bugs in MAKE_INFOLABwhich prevented from running under Linux

---------
BUG FIXES
---------
- Added missing condition in direct method engine which caused additional bias values to be computed uselessly for 'pt' bias correction.
