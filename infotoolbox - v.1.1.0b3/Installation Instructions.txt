The folder "infotoolbox - v.x.x.x" (where x.x.x is the downloaded version, e.g., 1.0.1) which includes this document,
is the "toolbox folder" which can be placed anywhere on your hard drive.

STEP 1 - ADDING THE TOOLBOX FOLDERS TO THE PATH
-----------------------------------------------
You can add the required folder to your MATLAB path in two ways

Method 1 (suggested):

	Use the script STARTUP_INFOTOOLBOX which was specifically created for this task. See the script's documentation for instruction of how to run this code.


Method 2:

	In the Set Path Matlab window (File>Set Path...) click the Add with Subfolders... button.
	Navigate to the toolbox folder, select it and save.
	It is important that you include the toolbox folder together with ALL of its subfolders in the Matlab's path in order for the toolbox to work.
	This method, though faster, has the disadvantage of having to save the path (which is typically not very good practice).


STEP 2
------
Type COMPUTER (in lower case) in the Matlab command window: a string will be returned specifying which platform Matlab is running on.
Depending on the content of this string proceed as follows:
- 'MACI': no additional step required.

- 'PCWIN': download Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86). This package is only required if Visual C++ is not already installed. It is suggested to reboot after installing the package.

- 'PCWIN64': download Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64). This package is only required if Visual C++ is not already installed. It is suggested to reboot after installing the package.

- 'GLNXA64': you need to compile MEX-files yourself (see Matlab documentation on how to setup the MEX environment). Simply run the Matlab script MAKE_INFOTOOLBOX.
