Changes to version 1.0.2
------------------------
- the function now checks (using MXGETNUMBEROFDIMENSIONS) that the number 
  of dimensions of R is 3 before  asking for Ns = size(R,3). Since, when 
  size(R,3) = 1, reading the number of elements in the 3rd dimension using 
  MXGETDIMENSIONS will result in leakage.
  
  With this additional check is now possible to input response matrices
  with just one stimulus index (this is useful e.g. for computing HR only).
